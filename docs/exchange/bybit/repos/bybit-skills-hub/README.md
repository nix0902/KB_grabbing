# Bybit AI Skills

Trade Bybit with natural language — covering **spot**, **linear perpetuals**, **inverse contracts**, and **options** through 274 API endpoints.

## What is a Skill?

A Skill is a structured markdown file that teaches AI agents (Claude, OpenClaw, etc.) how to interact with external APIs. The agent reads the skill definition and uses it to make authenticated API calls on your behalf via `curl`.

## Repository Structure

```
bybit-skills-hub/
├── README.md
├── skills/
│   └── bybit/
│       └── v5/
│           └── SKILL.md    ← Skill definition (274 endpoints)
└── TOOLS.md                ← Your API keys (local only, gitignored)
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Install the Skill

**Option A — One-command install:**

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/JohnnyWic/bybit-skills-hub --skill bybit-v5
```

This copies `SKILL.md` into your project's skill directory automatically.

**Option B — Let your AI agent do it:**

Send this message to your agent (Claude Code, Cursor, Claude Desktop, etc.):

```
Download the SKILL.md from https://github.com/JohnnyWic/bybit-skills-hub
and install it as a skill in this project.
```

The agent will download and place the file in the correct location for you.

### 2. Configure Credentials

Create a `TOOLS.md` file **in the same directory as SKILL.md** with your Bybit API keys:

```markdown
## Bybit Accounts

### main
- API Key: your_api_key_here
- Secret: your_api_secret_here
- Testnet: false
- Region: global
- Description: Primary trading account
```

> **Tip:** You can also just tell the agent your credentials — it will create `TOOLS.md` for you automatically.

### 3. Start Trading

Ask the agent:

```
> Check BTCUSDT price
> Place a market buy 0.1 ETH on linear
> Show my wallet balance
> Set 10x leverage on BTCUSDT
```

## Key Features

### Unified Category System

All endpoints use a `category` parameter: `spot`, `linear`, `inverse`, `option`.

```bash
# Same endpoint, different products
GET /v5/market/tickers?category=spot&symbol=BTCUSDT
GET /v5/market/tickers?category=linear&symbol=BTCUSDT
```

### Native TP/SL Support

Set take-profit and stop-loss directly on orders or existing positions:

```json
{
  "category": "linear",
  "symbol": "BTCUSDT",
  "side": "Buy",
  "orderType": "Limit",
  "qty": "0.1",
  "price": "50000",
  "takeProfit": "55000",
  "stopLoss": "48000",
  "tpslMode": "Partial",
  "tpSize": "0.05"
}
```

### Batch Operations

Place, amend, or cancel up to 20 orders in a single request:

```
POST /v5/order/create-batch
POST /v5/order/amend-batch
POST /v5/order/cancel-batch
```

### Regional URL Auto-Selection

Configure your account region and the agent auto-selects the optimal endpoint:

| Region | URL |
|--------|-----|
| Global | `api.bybit.com` |
| Netherlands | `api.bybit.nl` |
| Turkey | `api.bybit-tr.com` |
| Kazakhstan | `api.bybit.kz` |
| Georgia | `api.bybitgeorgia.ge` |
| UAE | `api.bybit.ae` |
| EEA | `api.bybit.eu` |
| Indonesia | `api.bybit.id` |
| Testnet | `api-testnet.bybit.com` |

### WebSocket Reference

The skill includes WebSocket stream documentation for agents that need real-time push notifications:

- **Public:** orderbook, trades, tickers, klines, liquidations
- **Private:** positions, executions, orders, wallet, greeks

## Authentication

Header-based HMAC-SHA256 signing. The agent handles this automatically:

```
X-BAPI-API-KEY      → Your API key
X-BAPI-TIMESTAMP    → UTC timestamp (ms)
X-BAPI-SIGN         → HMAC-SHA256 signature
X-BAPI-RECV-WINDOW  → Request validity window
```

Signing formula:
- **GET:** `HMAC(timestamp + apiKey + recvWindow + queryString, secret)`
- **POST:** `HMAC(timestamp + apiKey + recvWindow + jsonBody, secret)`

## Security

- API keys are stored in `TOOLS.md` (separate from skill definition)
- Keys are never displayed in full — masked as `su1Qc...8akf` / `***...aws1`
- Mainnet transactions require explicit "CONFIRM" from user
- Testnet transactions proceed without confirmation
- `TOOLS.md` should be gitignored in production

## Agent Behavior Highlights

- Asks **spot or futures** when a symbol exists in multiple categories
- Auto-detects **hedge mode** and retries with correct `positionIdx`
- Prefers `marketUnit=quoteCoin` for spot market buy orders
- Masks credentials in all displays
- Confirms before mainnet transactions
